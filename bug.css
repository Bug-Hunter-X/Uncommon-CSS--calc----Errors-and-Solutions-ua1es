The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it doesn't work as expected due to incorrect syntax or unit mismatches. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is correct, but `calc(100% - 10)` will lead to an error because the unit is missing for 10.  Another common issue is nesting `calc()` functions without proper parentheses, leading to unexpected results or errors.  Incorrect order of operations can also cause unexpected calculations. Using spaces around operators within `calc()` is crucial, as some browsers are stricter than others. Missing semicolons after declarations can also cause unexpected behavior.
